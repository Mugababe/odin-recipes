                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 ounces liver pate</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk, beaten</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>Directions</em></h3>
            <ol>
                <ol start="1">
                    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place beef in a small baking dish, and<br> spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until<br> browned. Remove from pan, and allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.<br></li>
                    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and mushrooms<br> in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool.<br></li>
                    <li>Mix together pate and 2 tablespoons softened butter, and<br> season with salt and pepper. Spread pate over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.<br></li>
                    <li>Roll out the puff pastry dough, and place beef in the center. Fold up, and seal all the<br> edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13 inch baking dish,<br> cut a few slits in the top of the dough, and brush with egg yolk.<br></li>
                    <li>Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 425 degrees<br> F (220 degrees C) for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden brown.<br> Set aside, and keep warm.<br></li>
                    <li>Place all reserved juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef stock and red<br> wine; boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Strain, and serve with beef.<br></li>
            
            
            
            </ol>
